What is it
---------------

PHPAuth is a secure user authentication class for PHP websites, using a powerful password hashing system and attack blocking to keep your website and users secure.

Features
---------------
* Uses [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) to hash passwords, a secure algorithm that uses an expensive key setup phase
* Uses an individual 128 bit salt for each user, pulled from /dev/urandom, making rainbow tables useless
* Uses PHP's [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) database interface and uses prepared statements meaning an efficient system, resilient against SQL injection
* Blocks attackers by IP for any defined time after any amount of failed actions on the portal
* No plain text passwords are sent or stored by the system
* Integrates easily into most existing websites, and can be a great starting point for new projects
* Easy configuration of multiple system parameters

User actions
---------------
* Login
* Register
* Activate account
* Resend activation email
* Reset password
* Change password
* Change email address
* Delete account
* Logout

Requirements
---------------
PHPAuth requires  PHP 5.3.7 and above, a MySQL database and PHP sendmail needs setting up correctly so that account activation emails get sent correctly.

Configuration
---------------

The database table `config` contains multiple parameters allowing you to configure certain functions of the class.

* `site_name` : the name of the website to display in the activation and password reset emails
* `site_url`: the URL of the Auth root, where you installed the system, without the trailing slash, used for emails.
* `site_email` : the email address from which to send activation and password reset emails
* `cookie_name` : the name of the cookie that contains session information, do not change unless necessary
* `cookie_path` : the path of the session cookie, do not change unless necessary
* `cookie_domain` : the domain of the session cookie, do not change unless necessary
* `cookie_secure` : the HTTPS only setting of the session cookie, do not change unless necessary
* `cookie_http` : the HTTP only protocol setting of the session cookie, do not change unless necessary
* `site_key` : a random string that you should modify used to validate cookies to ensure they are not tampered with
* `cookie_remember` : the time that a user will remain logged in for when ticking "remember me" on login. Must respect PHP's [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php) format.
* `cookie_forget` : the time a user will remain logged in when not ticking "remember me" on login.  Must respect PHP's [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php) format.
* `bcrypt_cost` : the algorithmic cost of the bcrypt hashing function, can be changed based on hardware capabilities

The rest of the parameters generally do not need changing.

How to secure a page
---------------

Making a page accessible only to authenticated users is quick and easy, requiring only a few lines of code at the top of the page:

```php
<?php
include("config.class.php");
include("auth.class.php");

    
$dbh = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=phpauth", "username", "password");

$config = new Config($dbh);
$auth = new Auth($dbh, $config);
    
if(!isset($_COOKIE[$config->cookiename]) || !$auth->checkSession($_COOKIE[$config->cookiename])) {
    header('HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden');
    echo "Forbidden";
	    
    exit();
}
?>
```
